Description: Install released _version.py from PyPI
 The Debian package uses the GitHub sources, as these include package tests.
 This patch installs the PyPI version of _version.py (also generated by
 versioneer.py, and converted to UNIX line endings) in place of the
 git-aware _version.py in the GitHub version.
